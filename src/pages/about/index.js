            I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking 
            for ransom I can tell you I don't have money, but what I do have are a very 
            particular set of skills. Skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills
            that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go 
            now that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you, but
            if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you and I will kill you.
