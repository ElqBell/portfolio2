If you are looking for a back-end developer, I can tell you I don't have the expertise, but what I do have are a very particular set of skills. Skills I have acquired over many cold and endless nights. Skills that make me a delight for people like you. If you exit this website now that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you, but if you decide to proceed, I will wait for your message, I will reply to you and I will write the best front-end code you've seen.",
